     <h1>Star Spangled banner</h1>

     <p>
       <br /> O say can you see, by the dawn’s early light,<br />
What so proudly we hail’d at the twilight’s last gleaming,<br />
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight<br />
O’er the ramparts we watch’d were so gallantly streaming?<br />
And the rocket’s red glare, the bombs bursting in air,<br />
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there,<br />
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave<br />
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave?<br />

<br />On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep<br />
Where the foe’s haughty host in dread silence reposes,<br />
What is that which the breeze, o’er the towering steep,<br />
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?<br />
Now it catches the gleam of the morning’s first beam,<br />
In full glory reflected now shines in the stream,<br />
’Tis the star-spangled banner - O long may it wave<br />
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave!<br />

<br />And where is that band who so vauntingly swore,<br />
That the havoc of war and the battle’s confusion<br />
A home and a Country should leave us no more?<br />
Their blood has wash’d out their foul footstep’s pollution.<br />
No refuge could save the hireling and slave<br />
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave,<br />
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave<br />
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.<br />

<br />O thus be it ever when freemen shall stand<br />
Between their lov’d home and the war’s desolation!<br />
Blest with vict’ry and peace may the heav’n rescued land<br />
Praise the power that hath made and preserv’d us a nation!<br />
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,<br />
And this be our motto - “In God is our trust,” <br />
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave<br />
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.
